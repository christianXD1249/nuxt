    description: "A mono-red equipment deck that turns Alexios into a one-man army. Load him with gear like Blackblade Reforged and Whispersilk Cloak, fuel big turns with rituals like Mana Geyser, and unleash chaos with Blasphemous Act, Spectacular Showdown, and Disrupt Decorum. Fast, explosive, and brutal — this deck wins through raw combat power and overwhelming damage."

    description: "This Rakdos deck revolves around Kuja’s token engine. At each end step, you create Wizard tokens that ping opponents whenever you cast noncreature spells. With enough cheap spells, the damage adds up quickly. Once four Wizards are on the battlefield, Kuja transforms into Flame Star, doubling all damage from your Wizards and turning small pings into devastating burn that quickly overwhelms opponents."

Treasure synergies fuel extra dice rolls and big plays, while artifact payoffs turn tokens into power, making the deck a perfect mix of luck and inevitability."
